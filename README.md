TrafficAye helps you make smart business decisions based on traffic flow.

# Short Pitch!

What does a high density pollution in a specific area tells you?
It tells you that it is not a good place to open an office or residential campus, but probably a good one to open a supermarket or shopping mall (because more activity in that region so potentially more customers!)

Traffic Eye plots real time pollution levels, by analyzing the flow of traffic through its cameras with the help of computer vision and advancements in Artificial Intelligence it is able to give specific data (for example, amount of pollution done by a specific car at some specific time of the day at some specific place! )

Using Traffic Eye you can:
  - Make smart investment decision for your business.
  - Bring more value to your clients as a consultancy firm.
  - Making better decisions regarding environment and publich Health and Safety as a govt.

## In-Depth Description for nerds!
We will use Image Recognition on running traffic cams to identify number plates, from there we will do a lookup on our data set to find the car model related to the number plate which, in turn will help us find the CO2 emmissions done per litre of fuel burned. Analysing the data in a time series format accross all traffic cams will give us accurate pollution data of each and every car and city in the local area.
